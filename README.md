### ðŸŽ„ Advent of Code Challenge 2024

Every day Iâ€™ll solve a new puzzle from [Advent Of Code](https://adventofcode.com/), and when Iâ€™m feeling adventurous,
Iâ€™ll try solving it in a different programming languages.

---

#### How to run the code

Each dayâ€™s solution might have specific instructions, but most are self-contained.
For Python, you can just run:

```bash
python dayN/main.py
```

where N is the day number.
